-A better movie list for couchpotato

the basic idea is to list out movies in a better format than the default movie list and allow for better sorting and searching.

So far I have the basics down. Importing, searching and sorting. More to come soon...

to use this AS IS, edit the settings in config/settings.yml.exmple with your couchpotato IP and API key and then rename it to settings.yml

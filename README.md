-A better movie list for couchpotato


For those times when you need a little more info than couchpotato gives you, but dont really want to scroll your movies in Kodi or XBMC or plex this app is for you!

the basic idea is to list out movies in a better format than the default movie list and allow for better sorting and searching.

So far I have the basics down. Importing, searching and sorting. More to come soon along with a better readme. Maybe even a todo list?

to use this AS IS, edit the settings in config/settings.yml.exmple with your couchpotato IP and API key and then rename it to settings.yml
